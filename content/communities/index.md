# The Zig community is decentralized
Anyone is free to start and maintain their own space for the community to gather.
There is no concept of “official” or “unofficial”, however, each gathering place has its own moderators and rules. 

If you started a new Zig community, you can add it to the list below by sending us a PR on GitHub.
